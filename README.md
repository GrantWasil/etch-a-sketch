# etch-a-sketch

This is the second project for The_Odin_Project.

Getting a decent grid system took alot of time for me. The bottom row still may change sizes
depending on the input from the user, which I still need to fix. I also would like to work on the
page formatting to make it look nicer.

I'm happy that I spent the extra time writing a If/Else statement to have the color fade as it
taught me a ton about referencing classes as well as adding additional ones.

Please let me know what other feedback you have for me!
